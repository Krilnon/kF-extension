# Enhancements for kirupaForum

A Chrome extension that provides features to kF that vB and Kirupa haven't, for one reason or another.

## 1. Better code display

The unfortunate output of the [code] and [php] tags is replaced by the fully-featured ACE editor.

## 2. Fewer ads

My recent experiences with small-screen browsing made me rue the 250px-wide column of ads that
appears on most pages of the forums.  This extension removes the 3 main ads that are displayed 
for registered users on the forums and reclaims a considerable amount of screen space!
